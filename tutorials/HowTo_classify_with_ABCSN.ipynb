    "Using the function `load_data`, the training and test sets we used are automatically loaded. However, if you are wanting to use ABC-SN to classify new supernovae, you won't be using this function. Instead, all you need is an array of spectra with the correct shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your array of spectra to classify, we'll call it `X`, should be a NumPy array with shape `(num_spectra, 1, num_wvl)` where `num_spectra` is the number of spectra and `num_wvl` is the size of each spectrum.\n",

    "ABC-SN was originally developed for a dataset of 17 classes. During development, we reduced this to just 10. The dictionaries `sn_dict_trn` and `sn_dict_tst` (they are identical) serve to help translate the class ID from 0-16 to 0-9. We can invert this dictionary to translate class IDs in the range 0-9 to the range 0-16 (see `sn_10_to_17`). ABC-SN will predict targets in a range of 0-9 which we can translate to the range of 0-16. We do this because we already have dictionaries defined that take a class ID in the range of 0-16 and translates it into the SN subtype name."
